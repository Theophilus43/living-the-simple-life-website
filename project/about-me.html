                <h2>My name is john and living the simply life saved my life</h2>
                <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>.I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
                <p>Things were terrible. I had a job i hated, ahome that i didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
                <h3>How I turned things aroud</h3>
                <p><strong>I was on the verge of breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage. Sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and i quit my job.</p>
                <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p>Now that i live the simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                <p>with how much it turned my life around,<strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how i did it</strong>and how others cab benefit from living a simple as well, which is why I started this site! </p>
